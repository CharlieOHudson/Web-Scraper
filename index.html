    <h2>what each person did</h2>
    This web scraper was largely a group effort. Because the original assignment gave no indication that the project must be separated into different sections, and that a changes should be made through pull requests, we decided that the best course of action would be to use collaboration to achieve the goal of the assignment. Therefore, it is complicated to differentiate precisely what each person contributed. The Twilio account and the code is on Charlie's account. Corinne made the HTML site and wrote most of the content on it. The actual coding was done sitting together at the computer, looking through websites together to create the functioning program. Since we all shared the one computer, it is hard to know what each person's contribution was.
